macOS Migration Instructions and Notes
====================================

Motivation
-----------
This guide is addressing the issue of increasing EvrmoreCore-QT.app (to be exact - Application Support directory) size when installed on mac's internal storage. 

The outcome of this guide is to help with safely transferring the Application Support directory and the app itself to an external storage.

Please use this guide if you have already installed Evrmore Wallet before using [this guide](https://github.com/EvrmoreOrg/Evrmore/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md)

Pre-Requisites
-----------
1. Your EvrmoreCore-QT.app is installed in internal storage
2. You have found the Application Support directory path ([navigate to this link](https://github.com/EvrmoreOrg/Evrmore/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md#running) to refresh your memory)
3. You have backed-up all the data from wallet (12-phrase, etc.)
4. Your external storage has APFS format (no tests have been conducted for other file formats like FAT, NTFS, EXT, etc.)
5. The external storage should be at least 100+ GiB

Guide
-----------
Connect your external storage to your mac. Confirm that the OS has detected the storage

```
Note: this example above is assuming your have copied App and support directory to the root path of your external storage. Edit the path if your path is different

6. Save the script (In menu bar File->Save)
7. Export the script to app (Export->File Format: App)
8. Pin your new app to the dock
9. Click on the app you have just created using AppleScript to verify that your EvrmoreWallet is working properly as before
